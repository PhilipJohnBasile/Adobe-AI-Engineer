## SLIDE 9: Pipeline Overview
**Duration:** 2 minutes

# Creative Automation Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    B[Campaign Brief] --> V[Validation]
    V --> G[Generation]
    G --> C[Composition]
    C --> CO[Compliance]
    CO --> L[Localization]
    L --> O[Output]
    
    G --> |Cache| CA[(Cache)]
    CA --> |Reuse| G
```

**Speaker Notes:**
The pipeline begins with campaign brief ingestion in YAML format. Validation ensures all required fields are present. Generation creates assets using DALL-E or retrieves from cache. Composition adds text overlays and adjusts aspect ratios. Compliance checks brand guidelines. Localization adapts for target markets. Finally, structured outputs are saved with complete reporting.

---

## SLIDE 10: Campaign Brief Structure
**Duration:** 2 minutes

# Campaign Brief Format

```yaml
campaign_brief:
  campaign_id: "summer_sale_2024"
  campaign_name: "Summer Sale Campaign"
  products:
    - name: "Sunglasses"
      description: "UV protection"
  target_regions: ["US", "UK", "DE"]
  target_audience: "Adults 25-45"
  campaign_message: "Summer savings!"
  brand_guidelines:
    primary_colors: ["#FF6B35", "#2E86AB"]
    logo_required: true
  output_requirements:
    aspect_ratios: ["1:1", "9:16", "16:9"]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
Campaign briefs use a structured YAML format that captures all necessary information. This includes campaign metadata, product details, target regions and audience, messaging, brand guidelines with specific colors and requirements, and output specifications including aspect ratios. This structure ensures consistency while allowing flexibility for different campaign types.

---

## SLIDE 11: Asset Generation Process
**Duration:** 3 minutes

# Intelligent Asset Generation

1. **Asset Discovery**
   - Check existing asset library
   - Identify reusable components
   - Calculate generation needs

2. **Smart Generation**
   - Prompt engineering for quality
   - Multi-provider orchestration
   - Cost optimization via caching

3. **Quality Control**
   - Automated quality scoring
   - Brand alignment verification
   - Performance prediction

**Code Example:**
```python
# Intelligent generation with caching
if asset_exists_in_cache(product_key):
    image = load_from_cache(product_key)
else:
    image = generate_with_dalle(prompt)
    cache_asset(product_key, image)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
Asset generation follows an intelligent three-step process. First, we discover existing assets to maximize reuse. Second, smart generation uses optimized prompts with multi-provider orchestration and aggressive caching. Third, quality control ensures brand alignment and predicts performance. This approach reduces costs by 60% while maintaining quality.

## SLIDE 36: Trade-offs & Decisions
**Duration:** 2 minutes

# Key Design Decisions

**Trade-offs Made:**
1. **Speed vs Quality**
   - Chose: Balanced approach
   - 30s generation with 95% quality

2. **Cost vs Features**
   - Chose: Core features first
   - Phased enhancement approach

3. **Automation vs Control**
   - Chose: Automated with overrides
   - Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

4. **Scale vs Simplicity**
   - Chose: Scalable architecture
   - Complexity managed through abstraction

**Speaker Notes:**
Several key trade-offs shaped our design. We balanced speed with quality, achieving 30-second generation at 95% quality. Core features were prioritized with enhancements phased. Automation includes human overrides for critical decisions. We chose scalable architecture while managing complexity through clean abstractions. These decisions ensure both immediate value and long-term viability.
