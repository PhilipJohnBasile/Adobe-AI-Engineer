Adobe – Forward Deployed AI Engineer
The Opportunity
As a Forward Deployed AI Engineer, you will own the end-to-end development and launch of GenAI
applications through Adobe and third-party generative models. You are an AI native who will embed
directly into customer teams to spin up proof points in days and co-develop features that enhance
customer value. If you thrive in start-up environments—scaling products from prototype to production,
pushing innovative research into real-world use cases, and owning product &amp; business outcomes—you’ll
fit right in here!
What You’ll Do
 Collaborate &amp; Innovate: Partner with Technical Architects, Engagement Managers and Product
teams to define customer requirements/use cases, facilitate technical workshops, and co-create
specific GenAI solutions.
 Prototype Rapidly: Apply an AI-first experimentation mindset—build proof points in days, iterate
on feedback, and drive quick wins. UX/UI and rapid prototyping skills are a plus.
 Engineer End-to-End: Design, build, and deploy full-stack applications and
microservices—integrating Firefly APIs, Common Extensibility Platform, GenStudio for
Performance Marketing, headless CMS architectures and UX/UI Designs.
 Bridge to Product: Capture field-proven use cases and funnel them back to Product &amp;
Engineering—fueling the Firefly roadmap.
 Automate &amp; Scale: Develop reusable components, CI/CD pipelines, and governance checks to
ensure consistent, repeatable delivery.
 Operate at Speed: Thrive in a constantly evolving, start-up-like environment—own delivery
sprints, tackle challenges on-site/remotely, and adapt to evolving AI trends.
 Share &amp; Elevate: Document your playbooks, prompts, and patterns in our internal knowledge
base—helping the whole organization move faster.
What You Bring
 Full-Stack Expertise: 3+ years as a full-stack developer or technical consultant building and
launching production software (React.js/Next.js/Angular; Node.js/Java Spring Boot;
REST/GraphQL, HTML, JavaScript, Java, XML).
 GenAI Mastery: Extensive hands-on experience with modern AI technologies, including: Large
Language Models (LLMs) – OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Mistral, etc. || Diffusion
models (Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, Midjourney) || Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines, vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS), and semantic search
|| Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and model optimization || AI agent frameworks (AutoGen,
LangChain, LlamaIndex) || Multimodal AI (text, image, video, audio processing)
 Cloud &amp; DevOps Expertise: Proficient with core services (EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudFormation)
and AI/ML tools (SageMaker, Bedrock) || Azure: Experience with compute (VMs, Functions),
storage (Blob), and AI services (Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services) || Containerization &amp;
Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless deployments || CI/CD &amp; IaC: GitLab CI/CD,

Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, or equivalent || Monitoring &amp; Logging: CloudWatch, Azure
Monitor, Datadog, or similar
 AI Tinkerer: AI-native tinkerer who embeds AI in your day-to-day workflows and spends your
free time inventing and tinkering with the possibilities of AI. You keep ahead of market trends
across third-party models, GPUs, and new AI applications.
 Adobe Fluency: Deep understanding of Adobe Creative Cloud APIs/SDK/CEP, Firefly Services
APIs, and nice to have: Adobe Experience Cloud integrations (AEM, Workfront Fusion, AJO or
equivalent experience).
 Customer-Centricity: Always prioritizing the customer and their needs and expectations first in
everything you do. You are outstanding at contributing to a culture of customer-centricity
among your team and your extended ecosystem.
 Strong communicator: You translate complex AI concepts for both engineers and executives and
guide customers through technical decisions aligned to business objectives.
 Startup DNA: Thrives in fast-paced, ambiguous environments—relentlessly seeking better,
faster, more innovative ways to solve customer objectives and challenges.
