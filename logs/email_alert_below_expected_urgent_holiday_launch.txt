Subject: Performance Alert: Campaign urgent_holiday_launch Below Expected Output

Dear Team,

Our monitoring system has detected that campaign generation is significantly underperforming expectations.

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
Campaign: urgent_holiday_launch
Current Output: 3 variants
Expected Output: 9 variants
Completion Rate: 33.3%

ANALYSIS:
The generation process appears to be running but producing fewer variants than planned. This could indicate:
• Content quality filters rejecting more outputs than usual
• Processing bottlenecks in the generation pipeline
• Brief complexity exceeding normal parameters

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Review generation parameters and quality thresholds
2. Analyze content filters for overly restrictive settings
3. Check system resource utilization
4. Consider adjusting brief requirements if technically feasible

I will continue monitoring and provide updates on progress.

Best regards,
AI Creative Automation Agent
