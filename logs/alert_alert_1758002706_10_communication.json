The current cost of $67.58 represents 135.2% of our budget, putting $675.80 of revenue at risk with a potential 0-hour delay in operations.\n\nThis high severity issue demands immediate action and C-suite notification to address the financial impact and operational risks we are facing.

Review API usage patterns and optimize batch processing\n2. Implement cost controls and rate limiting measures\n3. Evaluate alternative AI providers for cost optimization\n4. Update budget forecasts and alert relevant stakeholders\n5. **URGENT:** Conduct system maintenance to address the critically low success rate\n\nGiven the repeated nature of this issue and the critical impact on our operations, immediate escalation is required to ensure swift resolution and mitigation of further financial risks.\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this alert and confirm the initiation of necessary actions within the next 2 hours.
