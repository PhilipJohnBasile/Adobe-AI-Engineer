Subject: URGENT: Immediate Attention Required - Cost Spike Alert

Dear [Stakeholders],

I am writing to alert you of a critical situation regarding our daily API costs, which have exceeded the established threshold. The current cost of $67.58 represents 135.2% of our budget, putting $675.80 of revenue at risk with a potential 0-hour delay in operations.

This high severity issue demands immediate action and C-suite notification to address the financial impact and operational risks we are facing. Our system's success rate is alarmingly low at 16.7%, well below the 80.0% threshold, with 0/10 campaigns in the queue and no variants currently active.

In light of this urgent situation, I recommend the following actions be taken promptly:
1. Review API usage patterns and optimize batch processing
2. Implement cost controls and rate limiting measures
3. Evaluate alternative AI providers for cost optimization
4. Update budget forecasts and alert relevant stakeholders
5. **URGENT:** Conduct system maintenance to address the critically low success rate

Given the repeated nature of this issue and the critical impact on our operations, immediate escalation is required to ensure swift resolution and mitigation of further financial risks.

Please acknowledge receipt of this alert and confirm the initiation of necessary actions within the next 2 hours. Your prompt attention to this matter is crucial to safeguarding our financial health and operational efficiency.

Thank you for your immediate attention and cooperation in addressing this critical issue.

Best regards,
