Subject: URGENT: Action Required - Insufficient Variants in Campaign Generation

Dear Stakeholders,

I am writing to alert you to a critical issue regarding the recent campaign, campaign_e7e7cc9d, which has generated only 0 variants, falling significantly below the minimum requirement of 3 variants. This has resulted in a 1-hour delay and puts $15,000 in potential revenue at risk.

The current system performance indicates a success rate of 16.7%, well below the threshold of 80.0%. Additionally, the cost is at $67.58, exceeding the budget by 135.2%. With 0 variants in total and an average of 0.0 per campaign, urgent action is required to address this situation.

Given the severity of the issue, a team lead review is necessary within the next 4 hours to assess the impact and determine the appropriate course of action.

Recommended Actions:
1. Review generation parameters and quality thresholds
2. Check asset requirements and aspect ratio specifications
3. Consider temporarily lowering quality gates to meet deadlines
4. Engage the creative team for manual variant creation
5. **URGENT:** Due to the critically low success rate, consider immediate system maintenance

This alert marks the 8th issue today, with 7 high severity alerts. As this is a repeated issue requiring escalation, swift action is imperative to prevent further disruptions.

Please prioritize addressing these recommendations promptly to mitigate the financial risks and operational impact associated with the insufficient variants in campaign generation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
