Dear Stakeholders,

I'm writing to inform you of a critical issue affecting our Creative Automation Platform that requires immediate attention and decision-making.

## Executive Summary

Our GenAI API provider (OpenAI DALL-E) is experiencing significant service disruptions that are impacting our ability to generate creative assets for upcoming campaigns. This affects **4 high-priority campaigns** scheduled for launch this week, with potential revenue impact of **$125,000**.

## Current Situation

### Issue Details
- **Detected:** 2:15 PM EST today
- **Nature:** API rate limiting and provisioning constraints
- **Impact Level:** Critical - blocking asset generation
- **Current Capacity:** 25% of normal operations

### Affected Campaigns

| Campaign | Launch Date | Status | Revenue at Risk |
|----------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Summer Flash Sale | Sept 20 (3 days) | 41% complete | $45,000 |
| Back-to-School | Sept 22 (5 days) | 28% complete | $35,000 |
| Fall Fashion | Sept 24 (7 days) | 15% complete | $25,000 |
| Wellness Week | Sept 25 (8 days) | Not started | $20,000 |

### Root Cause

OpenAI is experiencing:
1. **Global capacity constraints** - Unprecedented demand exceeding infrastructure
2. **API rate limits reduced** - From 100 to 25 requests per minute
3. **Increased latency** - 3x normal response times
4. **Licensing tier restrictions** - Current tier insufficient for our volume

## Impact Assessment

### Creative Lead
- Asset delivery delayed by 48-72 hours at current rate
- Quality assurance timeline compressed
- Brand consistency at risk without proper review time

### Ad Operations
- Campaign launch dates in jeopardy
- Media buying slots may need rescheduling
- Potential penalties for missed deadlines: ~$15,000

### IT Department
- System operating at 25% capacity
- Increased error rates affecting other systems
- Support ticket volume increasing

### Legal/Compliance
- Compliance review timeline shortened
- Risk of non-compliant assets if rushed
- Potential regulatory issues in EU markets

## Actions Already Taken

✅ **Immediate Mitigation (Completed):**
1. Activated backup provider (Stability AI) - 40% capacity recovered
2. Implemented intelligent caching - 30% reduction in API calls
3. Prioritized Summer Flash Sale campaign in queue
4. Established direct contact with OpenAI support

🔄 **In Progress:**
1. Negotiating enterprise agreement with OpenAI for increased limits
2. Integrating Adobe Firefly as additional backup
3. Optimizing prompts to reduce token usage
4. Preparing manual creative assets as contingency
